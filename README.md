# 🦣 Elephant Detection in Satellite Images Using Deep Learning

## 📌 Overview
This project aims to detect **elephants in satellite images** using **YOLOv8**. The deep learning model is trained on a dataset of annotated images to **identify elephants and localize them with bounding boxes**. The goal is to assist in wildlife conservation efforts by monitoring elephant movements from aerial or satellite images.

## 🚀 Features
- 🕵️‍♂️ **Real-time Object Detection**
- 📦 **Bounding Box Visualization**
- 🎯 **High Accuracy**
- 🌍 **Satellite Image Compatibility**
- ⚡ **Optimized for Performance**
- 📊 **Evaluation with IoU & mAP Metrics**
